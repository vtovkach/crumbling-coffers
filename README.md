## General Information

**Crumbling Coffers** is a multiplayer platformer inspired by Metroidvania design principles.

The game features a large vertically explorable map filled with caves and interconnected areas. Players can traverse upward and downward freely, discovering items scattered across the environment.

The core objective is competitive collection:
- Up to **6 active players** compete within the same map.
- Items have different **rarity tiers** and **score values**.
- Matches are **time-based**.
- After time expires, a **scoreboard** displays all collected items and calculates each player's total score.

The game also includes temporary **boost items (spells)** that enhance abilities such as stamina, speed, and jump height, adding strategic depth to exploration and competition.
